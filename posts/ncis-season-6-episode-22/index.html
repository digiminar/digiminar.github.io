While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=watch-ncis-los-angeles---season-3-episode-18-the-dragon-and-the-fairy>Watch NCIS Los Angeles - Season 3 Episode 18: The Dragon And The Fairy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#watch-ncis-los-angeles---season-3-episode-18-the-dragon-and-the-fairy>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://static.123movies.link/image/film/-Rg3fY2SJR5jGM06ol5NVbY7ja8wcyCOR6PvoImCJK9ahtiNp8TVWtXd2EM8l-5pyOqtGFtXGTBtkZPI-HcNdUTvY5Er6wTtrnLMncEZUAk.jpg?1 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.EMcOL4UxwDn2Dxp5H5kr4AHaFj&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Watch NCIS Los Angeles - Season 3 Episode 18: The Dragon and the Fairy"><p><em>Source: ww1.123movies.link</em></p><blockquote><p>ncis 123movies gomovies.</p></blockquote><p>What is anime and why are people interested in it?
